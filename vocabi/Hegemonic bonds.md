So what Mises hints at / argues here is that if someone has submitted himself, he is no longer the actor except the constant resubmission. However, this does not mean that the action qua action of the ward extents to the submitted. The submitted submitting *is* his action - not the action of the director. There is no such thing as "extending ones action". Action is absolute and necessarily begins and ends with the individual, thereby nullifying threats as actual actions of violence. To determine whether or not one should allow threats is up for the market, i.e., the society to decide.
