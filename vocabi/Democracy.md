MES p1280 on democracy


![[Pasted image 20250312151526.png]]
1283, MES,
The very idea of national democracy is self-defeating.
since state borders are randomly assigned, then the district should be able to vote, then the city block, then the household, then the individual, if he disagrees then he should think that the continent should be able to vote and then a world government

according to the idea of direct democracy, this is already technologically possible. Every single person has a phone and can just vote directly on an app

additionally, if the argument is that direct democracy does not work because the voter is not knowledgeable enough to vote on the issues, then how is the voter knowledgeable enough to vote for a representative of the issues. In fact, he would actually have to know more in a representative than a direct democracy, because he would have to know everything about the issue AND the person representing him




### the judiciary

This is not a moral investigation, but it can hardly be argued that the majority will be making the morally right decisions, this can even be demonstrated in any deviance from any other "democratic system", as there can be only one morally correct way, thus any deviancy in morality undermines this point



### peaceful change

in addition to the above:

and forward.

Here Rothbard argues that if the idea is that democracy will exchange a vote for a violent overthrow, then it implies that the voters would have counted equally in a combat test, since their vote weighs the same. However, this cannot be true, and elderly does rarely perform as good as a young, a woman less than a man, a disabled less than someone who is not. 

What Rothbard might be getting to is that *any* deviance will result in a distortion. Voting assumes that equal value but that can never be the case, especially if we include relational and subjective value.

### democracy as a means

Democracy as a means, see calhoun "disquisition on government"



### Direct democracy

MES 1302 Here Rothbard goes back to the problem with assuming that people are competent enough to vote for representatives, but not competent enough to deal with their own affairs, but somehow competent enough to elect someone to do it for them
