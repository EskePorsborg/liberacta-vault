In Individualism and Economic Order, Hayek talks about the field of study which is economics. The a priori deduction of human action is used to demonstrate that social sciences can construct a logical and exhaustive classification of all possible forms of intelligible human behavior, i.e., we can understand human action through logical classification. Since economics is necessarily based on human action, then economics must study the meaningful choices rather than external physical factors, i.e., it is the choices of individuals that can be regarded as economic as they're living in a world of scarcity and must therefore necessarily economize their efforts

HA 235, "Economics is mainly concerned with the analysis of determination of money prices of goods and services exchanged on the market. In order to accomplish this task, it must start from a comprehensive theory of human action"

"market exchange and monetary calculation is inseparably linked together"
