An aggressor is necessarily a human engaged in human action. There is no difference between an intervener, invader, or aggressor in the sense that they are aggressors. One could argue that an intervener is a subcategory of an aggressor, however, an intervener has its own categories that include all types of aggression.

Here Rothbard put forth a potential definition a free society as "a world in which no one aggresses against the person of property of others"
![[Pasted image 20250207185757.png]]P1048, thus a free market does not exist as long as aggression exists. This also commits us to the view that if anything happens that violates property rights, even by mistake, then the society ceases to be categorized as free, i.e., we now have a socialist(unfree) society to the extent that it is not free.
