Here Hayek talks about the necessary assumptions of human action when being observed by another human. When interpreting another person's actions, one must necessarily interpret on the analogy of our own mind. He also notes that we cannot achieve certainty in relation to this.

Here Rothbard talks about how actions are only of individuals, never of collectives.

Another implication of action is that man must necessarily believe that acting on his desire must have a possibility of achieving what he seeks to achieve. Without this, there can be no action and as a result of an actualized action, man must necessarily believe that his action is sufficient for achieving what he seeks to achieve

HA 196.
"It is the essential characteristic of the categories of human action that they are apodictic and absolute and do not admit of any grada- tion. There is action or nonaction, there is exchange or nonexchange; everything which applies to action and exchange as such is given or not given in every individual instance according to whether there is or there is not action and exchange."
