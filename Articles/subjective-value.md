The **theory of subjective value** explains that the worth of a good or service is **not inherent**, but rather determined by the importance an individual places on it.

This means that value is:

- ðŸ’¡ **Subjective** â€” it varies from person to person.
- ðŸ“¦ **Contextual** â€” the same item may be more valuable in one scenario than another.
